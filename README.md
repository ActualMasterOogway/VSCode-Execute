## Installation

1. Install the extension from [the latest release](https://github.com/ActualMasterOogway/VSCode-Execute/releases/latest) and restart your Visual Studio Code
2. Download the [Connect.luau](https://github.com/ActualMasterOogway/VSCode-Execute/blob/main/Connect.luau) script and put the file in your 'autoexec' folder, or execute it everytime you rejoin.
3. In VS Code you will see a button called "Execute Code" in your status bar, everytime you press it the code of the current file you have opened will get sent to the executor and execute it.
